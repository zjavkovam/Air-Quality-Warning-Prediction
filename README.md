## Air Quality Warning Prediction Using Environmental Data

This project focuses on predicting whether an air quality warning should be issued based on environmental and pollutant data. The dataset includes attributes such as air quality measures (SO2, PM2.5, NOx, CO, O3, etc.), weather parameters (TEMP, PRESSURE), and location data (longitude, latitude).

### Data Cleaning & Transformation
The dataset undergoes extensive data cleaning and transformation to prepare it for analysis, with Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) conducted to uncover patterns and insights.

### Model Implementation
We implement a custom One Rule classifier and compare its performance against a Decision Tree model. The project also includes optimization of the models to improve prediction accuracy for issuing air quality warnings.
